## Country Data Manager

This is a Country Data Manager application created with TypeScript.

## Description

TypeScript is utilized to create an application that iterates a list of countries and their attributes, and then specifies countries that receive snowfall and their attributes, ultimately calculating the total annual snowfall level.

## Getting Started

There is a list of countries and their attributes in the application that are shown on the front-end. The logic is set so the user can go into the TypeScript file and change types of data and the app will still run (such as if there are no snowy countries).

## Dependencies

HTML5
TypeScript
JavaScript

## Installing

The `CS601_HW4_Mulpuri.zip` file contains all necessary files including HTML, CSS, and images.

To run the application:
1. Download and unzip CS601_HW4_Mulpuri.zip
2. Open index.html in your web browser
